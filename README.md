# Final-Project
## Project title
Comparing the Accuracy of CNN and Decision Tree Models in Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets
### About the project
The research uses sentiment analysis and vaccine efficacy assessment using a dataset of tweets related to COVID-19. The study uses an organized method that includes data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, data analysis to compare vaccines, and machine learning model construction and comparison.
## Project Workflow
### 1. Dataset
A dataset of tweets related to COVID-19 was collected, containing various public opinions, information, and discussions around the pandemic and vaccines from kaggle
### 2.Data Preprocessing
+ The raw tweet data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise, such as irrelevant symbols, hashtags, mentions, and links
+ Text normalization techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization were applied to prepare the data for analysis.
### Sentiment Analysis
+ Sentiment analysis was performed on the preprocessed tweets to classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of each tweet.
+ This step provided insights into public opinion during the pandemic and their reactions to different vaccines.
### Vaccine Efficacy Analysis
+ Through data analysis, the sentiment associated with tweets mentioning specific vaccines was analyzed.
+ The best-performing vaccine was identified based on the positive sentiment ratio
### Model Development
+ A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed to predict tweet sentiment based on text data.
+ Additionally, a Decision Tree model was also created to perform the same task.
### Model Comparison
+ The CNN and Decision Tree models were compared based on their performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Overall
The experiment effectively illustrated how machine learning techniques may be applied to examine public opinion about COVID-19 vaccines. By comparing the CNN model's performance to that of the Decision Tree model, important information about model selection for text-based sentiment analysis tasks was obtained. In addition, the analysis provided a data-driven viewpoint on vaccine efficacy by identifying the vaccine that had the greatest favorable public opinion during the pandemic.
